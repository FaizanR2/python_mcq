# python_mcq
Backend of an MCQ quiz made in python consisting of 10 questions
Used 10 functions for each question
Stored all of the functions in a list
Used a for loop to call the functions that are stored in the list

Getting tracback Nameerrors for soem questions sometimes, restarting seems to fix the issue but it is unpredictable
